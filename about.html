      <h1>Mike Murphy</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a senior at North Seattle College in the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science program.  This is not my first attempt at finishing my degree, 
        but this time around I will finally succeed in achieving this lifelong goal of mine.  In addition to my role as a student, I'm also a mid-career 
        cybersecurity professional working for the US Government.  I am exploring my options of whether I want to continue with my current career trajectory,
        pivot to a role that is more software engineering related, or change things up entirely and try to embark on a second career as a new engineer.  Whichever 
        path I end up following, I'm sure it will be exciting!

        Note: We'll learn about semantic tags more this week, but an article is a good semantic
        choice here to group the information about a single quote and the author/source. If
        you want to have multiple quotes, try duplicating this
        "card UI" structure
